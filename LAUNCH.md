# NFT Project Launch Roadmap 

This was passed along to me by a friend who was also given this from a friend. I've shared this document with many people who are launching projects and I've decided to document it nicely for easy access for everyone.

## Key ideas
- Momentum is the most important part of launching an NFT project.
- The ratio between the token supply and number of members online is key to a sell out.
- Retaining members and making the server look busy is a focus.
- A professional website can make or break a project. 
- A responsive team from each timezone is important.

## Before marketing: 
- Make sure that discord is completely setup.
- Website fully developed and deployed to production.
- Professional looking Twitter with relevant content.
- Relationship made with secondary marketplace so you can get verified quickly after launch.
- Minting details (mint price, mint date, mint period, total supply, etc)  must be finalized.
- Full team employed 
- Complete roadmap for lead up to launch 

## Discord Channels:

## Good Mods Are Crucial

NFT’s can be confusing/overwhelming and investors will need help. Having a solid team of mods who can answer questions quickly at all times of the day is very important. There is no point in marketing and building hype if we can not help those who our marketing campaign has brought to our channel. 

Having all of your discord channels set up with all the relevant details is just the first step, having a team ready to keep the chat active and answer questions promptly is the follow through needed to close investors.

Nothing is worse than someone joining the server, not knowing how to get whitelisted or enter competitions, spamming the chat and no one answering. It makes the project look awful and you need to remember that 90% of people that join will not interact with the chat, they will just watch and assess the potential of the project.

Your entire goal here is to make the project look as well run as possible. That builds trust and in turn will allow you to sell out.


## Ready to Launch

Once you have everything set up as stated above, you are ready to launch.

The key to launching most NFT projects is **hype**, unless you have some amazing new technology that others haven't managed to code before you, you need hype.

_If you have innovative code and new ideas then the project will blow up naturally._

But if you are just like 99% of NFT projects and are trying to sell some random artwork or with the promise that they will be usable in a game that is coming in the future. You need hype!

I have found that a 1-2 week time period is all you need to go from launch to mint. If you take longer than this it is extremely hard to keep up the momentum and momentum is key to getting a sell out.


## Example Timeline

Below I will outline all the announcements and promotional ideas one could implement in order to have a successful week before minting.

### Day1
- Twitter announcements - IF you have budget then contact established names in the NFT community and pay for them to send out a promotional tweet for you
- Reddit announcements - Try and get a post out on as many NFT/Crypto related subreddits
- Discord invite bot - Pay for a bot that will go through other NFT servers and DM members advertising your discord
- Announce roadmap
- Launch whitelist announcement + Launch announcement - let people know that the first 500 people to join and get 3 invites will be given whitelist
- Once the 500 spots are filled up announce phase 2 - Phase 2 should be 5 invites + level 5, this can be for another 500 spots
- Once Phase 2 is complete release Phase 3 - 500 more WL spots for anyone who gets 15 invites + lvl 8 *Note that no more whitelist spots should be given away in this manor after

_Make announcements each time whitelist phases are filled up. Congratulate the people that got in and say for people to keep their eyes on announcements for the next chance for whitelist later today._ **Key is to drag out the announcements so there are constant announcement**

### Day 2
- Twitter giveaway - Get a twitter giveaway going, again pay a known NFT twitter whale to promote if you have the capital
- Art Contest - Giveaway a free NFT for first and Whitelist spots
- Announce sneak peek 1

### Day 3
- Invite competition - Once whitelist phase 3 is sold out, announce a invite competition, top prize if NFT’s + Crypto, lower prizes are whitelist spots (All payments are made after mint)
- Level competition - Anyone getting Level 15+ will get whitelist, all spammers will not get the WL
- Announce twitter winners

### Day 4
- Twitter giveaway - Need constant announcements to keep eyes on the project
- Announcement welcoming all new members and highlighting the ways of getting WL
- Announce member milestones 5k, 10k, 20k, etc - Keep hype up
- Meme contest - More WL spot chances

### Day 5
- Announce twitter winners
- Announce Art contest winners
- Announce the invite contest leaderboard
- Announce story contest
- 2nd Sneak peek

### Day 6
- Meme contest winners
- Invite competition winners
- Level contest winners’ announcement
- Using a Google Form get people to submit their wallet for whitelisting 

### Day 7
- Minting day announcement
- Story contest winners
- Time to sell out!!

_Note: This is just an outline, you can change the timeline and specifics, so they fit your project. They key is having 3-4 announcements each day which keep eyes coming back to the server and the hype at maximum levels. Have a solid team ready to answer all incoming questions because there will be tons going on and that chat should be absolutely flying._
