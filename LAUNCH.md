# NFT Project Launch Roadmap 

## Key ideas
- Momentum is the most important part of launching an NFT project.
- The ratio between the token supply and number of members online is key to a sell out.
- Retaining members and making the server look busy is a focus.

- A responsive team from each timezone is important.

## Before marketing: 
- Make sure that discord is completely setup.
